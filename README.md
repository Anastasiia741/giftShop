## MVVM Architecture

This project adopts the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture for application logic.

- **Model:**
The Model represents the data and business logic of the application. It is responsible for handling data storage, retrieval, and manipulation. In an MVVM architecture, the Model notifies the ViewModel of any changes in the data.
- **View:**
 The View is responsible for displaying the user interface and presenting data to the user. It observes the ViewModel for any updates and reflects changes in the UI. The View is declarative and focuses solely on presentation, without containing business logic.
- **ViewModel:**
 The ViewModel acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It receives user input from the View, processes it as needed, and updates the Model accordingly. The ViewModel also exposes data and commands to the View, allowing for binding and easy data synchronization. It ensures a separation of concerns by managing the application's logic and state, while the View remains focused on displaying the UI.
